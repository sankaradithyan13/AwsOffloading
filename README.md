There is a connection set up between a client, monitor, AWS, ServerA, ServerB and ServerC and exchanged messages between then using TCP and UDP protocols. The Client and Monitor are connected to the AWS using 2 separate TCP sockets and the AWS and ServerA, ServerB, ServerC are connected using single UDP socket. The client will enter the link_id, file_size and signal_power and will be received by AWS which will then forward the received data to Monitor, ServerA, ServerB and ServerC. The Monitor will display the data and ServerA and ServerB will search for the other parameters of link_id in the database and return whether data is present in the either database_a or database_b and return the values to AWS. The data received by AWS from either ServerA or ServerB will be sent to ServerC for computational offloading where the various delay values will be calculated. 
The order in which the program will be executed is open 6 different terminals. On the first terminal run "make all" which will compile all the 6 different C++ files. Then on the other five terminals run the following command in the same order as "make serverA", "make serverB", "make serverC", "make aws", "make monitor". The first terminal will act as the client to give the input in following format "./client <link_id> <file_size> <signal_power>".
